The goal of ShinyLipidcountr is to build an excel workbook that contains quantified lipidomics data and graphs. The shiny app is able to read LipidView and LipidXplorer report files to calculate concentrations of various lipid species.

## Installation

You can install the development version of ShinyLipidcountr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("luechtian/ShinyLipidcountr")
```

## Getting started

You need LipidView or LipidXplorer for peak processing and annotation of your mass spectrometric data. This app accepts text-files and csv-files with a specific format.

For LipidView-output, use target lists and only the "MarkerView" export option in LipidView

## 

A LipidView-textfile in a spreadsheet looks like this:
<img src='man/figures/lv_table.PNG' /></a>






You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
